### Specific Use Cases
1. **Initial Project Setup**: Generated project structure and configuration files
2. **Database Schema Design**: Created Prisma models with relationships
3. **API Development**: Built RESTful endpoints with proper error handling
4. **Frontend Components**: Developed React components with TypeScript
5. **Styling Implementation**: Applied Tailwind CSS with custom cyber theme
6. **Bug Fixing**: Resolved configuration and compatibility issues

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Design
- **Choice**: SQLite with Prisma ORM
- **AI Input**: Suggested normalized schema with proper relationships
- **Key Models**: User, Customer, Deal, Task with foreign key relationships
- **Rationale**: Lightweight for development, easily scalable to PostgreSQL

### API Architecture
- **Choice**: RESTful API with Express.js
- **AI Guidance**: Recommended standard REST patterns with proper HTTP methods
- **Structure**: Controller-based architecture with middleware layers
- **Security**: JWT authentication, input validation, rate limiting

### Frontend Architecture
- **Choice**: React with TypeScript and component-based architecture
- **State Management**: React hooks and context for authentication
- **Routing**: React Router v7 for navigation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom cyber/neon theme

## Challenges & Solutions

### Technical Challenges

#### 1. Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration
- **Problem**: Unknown utility class errors with new Tailwind v4 syntax
- **AI Solution**: Updated configuration from `@tailwind` directives to `@import "tailwindcss"`
- **Resolution Time**: 15 minutes with AI assistance

#### 2. Modal Z-Index Issues
- **Problem**: Modals appearing behind other elements
- **AI Solution**: Increased z-index to `z-[9999]` for all modal components
- **Resolution Time**: 5 minutes

#### 3. Input Text Visibility
- **Problem**: Text in input fields not visible due to color inheritance
- **AI Solution**: Added `text-black` class to all input elements
- **Resolution Time**: 10 minutes

#### 4. Task Management API Integration
- **Problem**: 500 errors when updating tasks due to extra fields
- **AI Solution**: Filtered data to send only required fields to API
- **Resolution Time**: 20 minutes

#### 5. Date Format Compatibility
- **Problem**: ISO date strings incompatible with HTML date inputs
- **AI Solution**: Converted dates using `toISOString().split('T')[0]`
- **Resolution Time**: 5 minutes

### AI Limitations
- **Complex Business Logic**: Required manual refinement for workflow logic
- **Design Decisions**: Needed human input for UX/UI choices
- **Performance Optimization**: Required manual analysis for bottlenecks

### Breakthrough Moments
1. **Rapid Component Generation**: AI generated complete modal components in minutes
2. **Error Diagnosis**: AI quickly identified root causes of configuration issues
3. **Code Pattern Recognition**: AI maintained consistent coding patterns across the project
